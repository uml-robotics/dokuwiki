A new user has registered.
The user currently has limited access, if any.
Please add the user to the appropriate group by going to @DOKUWIKIURL@ admin/usermanager.
Also, remove the user from default @user.

Guidelines:
  * @lab-member group gives the widest permissions with exceptions, people working in the lab should generally be added to this group
  * No one should ever be added to @admin except for one dedicated user.
  * If your case can not be covered by existing groups, create a new one (e.g. for people from another university), but ONLY if it can not be covered by existing groups. We do not want to have 100 groups.
